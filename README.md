# git-author
An easy way to setup multiple authors based on `git commit --template`. It
depends on `git-together`

# Dependency
https://github.com/kejadlen/git-together is required to run `git-author`.

# Setup
`setup.sh` simply created a `.git-author` file as the home directory, and also
configure the git to use that file as `commit.template`.

# Usage
Follow the instruction from https://github.com/kejadlen/git-together to setup
the `git-together` configurations. Then, `git-author` can use the initials from
the `git-together` to populate the template file.

```
# pairing with James and Naomi
git author jh nn

# soloing
git author jh

# mobbing
git author jh nn ca

# show who are included in current ~/.git-author
git author
```

Then, a regular commit by `git commit` can automatically include all the
authors with prefix `Author:`, e.g.

```
# mobbing
git author jh nn ca

# commit
git commit

# the commit message is pre-populated as:


Author: James Holden <jholden@rocinante.com>
Author: Naomi Nagata <nnagata@rocinante.com>
Author: Chrisjen Avasarala <avasarala@un.gov>
```

# Why
`git-together` is a wonderful tool to change the `author` and `commit` fields
in the git commit object, and rotate the authors automaticaly to evenly
distribute the credit. However, both `author` and `commit` fields can be easily
updated by future merging, rebasing, cherry-picking etc.

Also, `git-together` cannot put multiple authors directly into same commit,
e.g. it can only support one `Signed-off-by:` message generated by `git commit
--signoff`.

`git-author` is created to extend the `git-together` capability, so that all
the authorship information will be captured as part of the commit message,
hence, it won't care about who actually tracked in the `author` and `commit`
fields in the git log.
